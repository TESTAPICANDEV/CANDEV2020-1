Problem Statement: Provide management with a suite of interactive visualizations
That combine a variety of communications and Marketing Data data such as:
- Social Media
- Web Data
- Contact Center Data
- Media Relations
- Public Opinion Research (POR)
The goal should be to tell a story with all this data, there is lots of data in these folders but we should be able to provide insights that align with the business and responsibilities within ISED
