Problem Statement: Provide management with a suite of interactive visualizations
That combine a variety of communications and Marketing Data data such as:
- Social Media
- Web Data
- Contact Center Data
- Media Relations
- Public Opinion Research (POR)
The goal should be to tell a story with all this data, there is lots of data in these folders but we should be able to provide insights that align with the business and responsibilities within ISED

Our Solution: 

We made a tool which will be helpful for senior officials at ISED to evaluate "how Social Media posts done by Marketing Team have an impact on the Contact Center/ Media Relations transcations" The tool provides an interactive dashboard for the user to select start and end dates of a social media compaign and will invoke visualizations that might help the stake holders to evaluate how social media effected the Contact center Department in terms of type of inquiries, topics inquired and programs inquired by the clients. 

Files :

The Jupyter notebook _ 1 is the main file which hosts the source code and the visualizations are shown using the POWER BI Desktop
